# Pancreas-Segmentation
Pancreas Segmentation UNet


We are trying to make a model for inhancing the health system for pancreas segmentation depending on semantic segmentation tech. this for educational purposes.

To run the code be sure that you have the following :
Python 3.9.16
tensorflow 2.11.0
keras 2.11.0


commands to run the code:
python blocks.py --> For creating a basic blocks for u-net model with attention gates 

python model.py --> creating a compiled model that is ready for training on any dataset with segmented masks for pancreas segmentation.
